description: Reusable hooks, utilities, and types for your React applications.

# Introduction

**Stash** is a collection of re-usable hooks, utility functions, and TypeScript types that you can copy and paste into your apps.

It is built on the same design philosophy as [shadcn/ui](https://ui.shadcn.com/). Instead of installing a massive npm package with generic functions, you use a CLI to add only the specific logic you need directly to your codebase.

## Why not an npm package?

The goal is ownership and flexibility.

1.  **Ownership:** When you add a hook, the code becomes yours. You can modify the types, adjust the logic, or strip out parts you don't need.
2.  **Zero Bloat:** You don't need to install `lodash` just to debounce a function. You install `use-debounce`, and that is all you get.
3.  **Transparency:** You can see exactly what the code is doing. There are no hidden abstractions inside a compiled `node_modules` folder.

## Relation to shadcn/ui

While shadcn/ui provides the **visual** layer (buttons, dialogs, inputs) typically stored in `components/ui`, Stash provides the **logic** layer typically stored in `hooks` and `lib/utils`.

*   **shadcn/ui**: Handles how things look (`components/ui/button.tsx`).
*   **Stash**: Handles how things work (`hooks/use-debounce.ts`).

It fills the gap for common requirements like state management, DOM interaction, and data formatting that almost every project needs but shouldn't require a heavy third-party dependency.

import { Tab, Tabs } from 'fumadocs-ui/components/tabs';

## Quick Start

Initialize the project to configure your file paths:

<Tabs items={["npm", "pnpm", "yarn", "bun"]}>
  <Tab value="npm">
  ```bash
  npx stash-ts@latest init
  ```
  </Tab>
  <Tab value="pnpm">
  ```bash
  pnpm dlx stash-ts@latest init
  ```
  </Tab>
  <Tab value="yarn">
  ```bash
  yarn dlx stash-ts@latest init
  ```
  </Tab>
  <Tab value="bun">
  ```bash
  bunx stash-ts@latest init
  ```
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

Add a hook or utility:

<Tabs items={["npm", "pnpm", "yarn", "bun"]}>
  <Tab value="npm">
  ```bash
  npx stash-ts@latest add use-debounce
  ```
  </Tab>
  <Tab value="pnpm">
  ```bash
  pnpm dlx stash-ts@latest add use-debounce
  ```
  </Tab>
  <Tab value="yarn">
  ```bash
  yarn dlx stash-ts@latest add use-debounce
  ```
  </Tab>
  <Tab value="bun">
  ```bash
  bunx stash-ts@latest add use-debounce
  ```
  </Tab>
</Tabs>
